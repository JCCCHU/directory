# Employee Directory

This is a barebones employee directory application, based primarily on the "Friends" app from the Week 19 activities.

A list of employees is imported through the employees.json, where their id, name, occupation, and location are listed.

The user can sort employees alphabetically by clicking the "Sort Employees" button.

There are significant improvements that could have been made here:

* There is essentially no CSS at all.
* There is no ability to filter users at the moment.
* There could have been more information added to users; such as profile pictures, date of employment, their managers/reports, etc.

Lots of room to work on here.
